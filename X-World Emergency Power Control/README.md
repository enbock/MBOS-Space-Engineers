# Emergency Power Controll
We want a Battery Powered Station.
Externel Ships give us power to charge.
But if we charge an someone disconnect, we are out pf power.

So here the idea: 2 Batteries, one is charging, the other on auto mode.
Is one under 5%, then the mode is switching.
At 100% is switch again to charge the other one.

So we are safe, that a least one battery is available.

## Installation
Create 2 Batteries. Put "Emergency Power" in the CustomData.
