# MBOS-Space-Engineers
Space Engineers: Message Bus Operating System

A modularized message controlled system through multiple programable blocks. 

## Idea 
The programmable block are very limtied for complex system, e.g. automatic navigation and cargo loading systems. 
The MBOS allows to develop multiple small modules which interacts together through a message bus. 

The system is inspired by $IOS:

## Working on it... 
The system used MBOS as prefix. Anyone in the workshop are welcome to add modules. 
Detailed description will follow.... ;) 

## Add-Ons 
The MBOS will work on full vanilla and don't need any Add-Ons or extensions in Space Engineers.
